* **draft-richanna-http-message-signatures**: This document describes a mechanism for creating, encoding, and validating digital signatures or message authentication codes over subsets of elements within HTTP messages. This is derived from draft-cavage-http-signatures-12, and is intended to be submitted to the IETF HTTP Working Group.
* **draft-richanna-http-jwt-signature**: This document is a proof-of-concept attempt to split the JWT-based HTTP message signature definition out from draft-ietf-oauth-signed-http-request-03 into a separate draft that could be submitted to the IETF HTTP Working Group.
* **draft-richanna-oauth-http-signature-pop**: This document is a proof-of-concept attempt to split the OAuth PoP-specific content out from draft-ietf-oauth-http-request-03 into a separate profile draft that could be submitted to the IETF OAuth Working Group.
